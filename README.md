This project is a research project into the emulation of an 8080 chipset. The emulator is semi-functional in the sense that 
I can run it, but the opcodes have not been tested for accuracy yet. I am trying to write it in only C and plan to 
emulate the hardware using SDL. Any comments or insights are welcome :)
